    <h1>Notice when your mind has wandered</h1>
    <p>
      Inevitably, your attention will leave the breath and wander to other
      places. When you get around to noticing that your mind has wandered—in a
      few seconds, a minute, five minutes—simply return your attention to the
      breath.
