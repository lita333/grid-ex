    <h1>Be kind to your wandering mind and close with kindness</h1>
    <p>
      Don’t judge yourself or obsess over the content of the thoughts you find
      yourself lost in. Just come back. When you’re ready, gently lift your gaze
      (if your eyes are closed, open them). Take a moment and notice any sounds
      in the environment. Notice how your body feels right now. Notice your
      thoughts and emotions.
